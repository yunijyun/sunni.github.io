                                                                                          This is a German Christmas market.Recently, many Christmas markets have become popular in Japan, but I would like to visit the authentic German Christmas market once.
	                                                                                  At the Christmas market, you can find a lot of German regional dishes and Christmas-related goods.
	If you are over 20 years old you will be able to enjoy different types of German liquor.The Christmas market in Japan is also gorgeous and nice, but the authentic ones will be even more gorgeous and will be able to enjoy Christmas even more.
